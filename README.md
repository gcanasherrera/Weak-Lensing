# Weak-Lensing

Synopsis
====================
Weak Lensing is a repository that contains a set of programs plus the main script required to detect clusters of galaxies provided a .fits image of a sky region. The detection of these cluster of galaxies is performed thanks to the concept of Weak Lensing. Light coming from distant objects suffers a deviation due to the mass present in the universe.This deviation produces a shear in the size of distant objects which can be measured.

DOCUMENTATION
====================
Weak-Lensing package is divided in different parts. The Main Script develops several steps required to measure the shear of ddistant objects. The procedure is based in 22 different steps, whose description is commenting in WL_Script.py. WL_Script has an auxiliary program that contains set of defined functions called by the Main Script (WL_Utils.py).Finally, the package contains three programs whose goals and relation with WL_Script.py are described below.
