# Weak-Lensing Package

Synopsis
====================
Weak Lensing is a repository that contains a set of programs required to detect clusters of galaxies provided a FITS image of a sky region. The detection of these cluster of galaxies is performed thanks to the concept of Weak Lensing. Light coming from distant objects suffers a deviation due to the mass present in the universe.This deviation produces a shear in the size of distant objects which can be measured.
